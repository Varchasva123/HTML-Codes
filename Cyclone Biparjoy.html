        <pre>
         Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Biparjoy is a powerful tropical cyclone that formed over the east-central Arabian Sea and
         made landfall near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Pakistan_border"><big><b>India-Pakistan border</b></big></a>. The third depression and the second cyclonic storm of the 2023 North Indian 
         Ocean cyclone season, Biparjoy originated from a depression that was first noted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Meteorological_Department"><big><b>India Meteorological Department(IMD)</b></big></a>
         on 6 June, before intensifying into a cyclonic storm. The cyclone steadily weakened due to deep flaring convection. 
         Biparjoy accelerated northeastward, strengthening to a Category 3-equivalent tropical cyclone and to a extremely severe 
         cyclonic storm.

                Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Biporjoy moved on towards Rajasthan after <br> leaving behind a trail of destruction in <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutch_district"><big><b>Gujarat's
                Kutch region</b></big></a> on June 15, 2023. <br>
                The cyclone fortunately did not cause human casualties although a father-and-son goatherd duo died while rescuing <br>
                their flock in a flooded ravine in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavnagar"><big><b>Saurashtra region's Bhavnagar district</b></big></a>, according to media reports. <br>
                More than 20 electricity poles fell in 940 villages. Some 22 people sustained injuries. There were 23 cattle deaths <br>
                while 524 trees fell to the ground under the impact of the winds.

                        Biparjoy developed into a cyclone in the early morning hours of June 6. According to Roxy Mathew Koll, <br>
                        a climate scientist at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Tropical_Meteorology"><big><b>Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology</b></big></a>, sea surface temperatures in the <br>
                        Arabian Sea were 31°C to 32°C in early June, which was 2°C to 4°C above the climatological mean. A rule of <br>
                        thumb among scientists is that ocean temperatures should be above 27°C to sustain a tropical cyclone

                        Unusually warm waters helped fuel Biparjoy's rapid intensification twice in its lifetime.<br>
                        Between June 6 and 7, Biparjoy's wind speed increased from 55 to 139 kilometers per hour <br>

                        with a sustained wind speed of 125 to 135 kilometers per hour, impacting India's western state of Gujarat and <br>
